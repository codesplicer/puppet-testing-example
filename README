This is some code that goes together with my presentation on PuppetCamp
on puppet module testing. 

You can view the talk here: http://vstone.eu/talks/puppet-module-testing
If you plan on reusing it, which I encourage, I also suggest you improve it
here: https://github.com/vStone/talk-puppet-module-testing-revealjs

If you feel like a basic example test is missing, I also encourage you to
send out a pull request which I will glady accept.
